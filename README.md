Electronic Arts Software Engineering 
Virtual Intenship


I recently participated in Electronic Arts’ virtual job simulation on Forage, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it’s like to work collaboratively in a game development environment at Electronic Arts. 
I learned to use C++ and developed valuable skills like writing Feature Proposals, building class diagrams and codebase optimization in a realistic context as a software engineer working on the Sims 4. 
Through this program I realized that I really enjoy developing features for video games and would love to apply what I've learned in a game development team at a company like Electronic Arts.

Inventory Management System

Overview:
The Inventory Management System is a simple C++ application that allows users to manage an inventory of items. It provides functionalities to add items, sell items, and list all items in the inventory. The program uses object-oriented principles such as abstraction and encapsulation to manage the inventory effectively.

Features:
  Add Item: Add a new item to the inventory with its name, quantity, and price.
  Sell Item: Sell a specified quantity of an item. If the quantity reaches zero, the item is removed from the inventory.
  List Items: Display all items in the inventory along with their details.

Prerequisites:
- A C++ compiler.
- Basic understanding of C++ and object-oriented programming.

Files
  Item.h : Header file defining the `Item` class.
  Inventory.h : Header file defining the `Inventory` class and related functions.
  main.cpp : Main file containing the `main` function and user interaction logic.
